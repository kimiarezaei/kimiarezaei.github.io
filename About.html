    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi, I am Kimia Rezaei, a PhD candidate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University College Cork
            and
            the INFANT
            Research Centre. My research focuses on
            developing AI models for the automatic diagnosis of neonatal brain-related conditions by leveraging ECG
            signals as an alternative to EEG,
            using signal processing, machine learning and deep learning techniques.</p>

        <p>Previously, I worked on machine learning approaches for analyzing brain-related medical images. I also
            have over five years of experience in the telecom industry, where I was part of a technical maintenance
            team.</p>

        <p>I'm passionate about applying Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and enthusiastic about exploring its
            potential across other domains.</p>
