    <p>I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering PhD student at University College Cork, Ireland, with a strong
        foundation in academic research that has resulted in publications, along with valuable hands-on experience in
        the industrial sector.
        I am currently specializing in modeling infant brain and heart signals, collaborating with the INFANT Research
        Centre as part of my PhD.
        Proficient in Python, I possess expertise in image processing, signal processing, machine learning, and deep
        learning techniques, complemented by a deep familiarity with relevant libraries.
        I am enthusiastic about delving into various Artificial Intelligence domains.</p>
